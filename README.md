WebGL accelerated Game of Life for JS. Try it out [here](https://dirktoewe.github.io/game_of_js/game_of_life.html). A few words about the cryptic controls:

  * Use mouse wheel to zoom in and out
  * Left-click drag the mouse to move the board
  * Use right-click to either toggle cells or to insert patterns
  * Insertible patterns can be selected from the `<Toggle Cell>` dropdown
  * The `16 ms` dropdown allow to adjust the minimum delay between simulation steps. The higher the delay the slower the simulation.
